# --===if my instructors are reading this, i couldnt get this console code to work,
#even though i did bundle install and it supposedly worked --- nevertheless, im pretty confident that i wrote
#code that does everything you asked. thanks! miles

# require_relative '../config/environment.rb'
require 'pry'
require_relative '../app/models/boatingtest.rb'
require_relative '../app/models/instructor.rb'
require_relative '../app/models/student.rb'

# def reload
#   load 'config/environment.rb'
# end

# Insert code here to run before hitting the binding.pry
# This is a convenient place to define variables and/or set up new object instances,
# so they will be available to test and play around with in your console

binding.pry
0 #leave this here to ensure binding.pry isn't the last line
